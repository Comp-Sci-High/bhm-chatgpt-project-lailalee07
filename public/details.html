        <h1 class="details-title">Baggy Clothes</h1>
        <p class="details-description"> 
    <p>Baggy clothing became a major Black fashion trend in the late 1980s and 1990s, heavily influenced by hip-hop culture. Rooted in prison uniforms and the hand-me-down tradition, oversized jeans, hoodies, and jerseys symbolized resistance, individuality, and street style. Rappers and athletes embraced the look, while Black-owned brands like FUBU, Karl Kani, and Sean John helped bring it to the mainstream. The trend became a defining element of urban fashion, shaping streetwear and influencing global style for decades.
